_Last updated: 12/16/25_

OFFLINE DC INC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the **Dumb Down** mobile application (the “App”).
This Privacy Policy explains how we access, use, and protect information when you use the App.

We are committed to minimizing data use and to processing personal information **only as necessary
to provide the App’s core functionality**.

## 1. Information We Access and Use

### A. SMS Messages and Notifications

With your explicit permission, the App accesses incoming SMS messages and notification content
**solely for the purpose of forwarding messages to a user-connected dumb phone**.

The App may access:

- Message content
- Sender phone number
- Group chat context (when applicable)

- Messages are processed locally on your device.
- Messages are **not transmitted to our servers**.
- Messages are **not used for analytics, advertising, or profiling**.

Forwarding occurs **only after you explicitly enable text syncing during setup**.

### B. Contacts

With your permission, the App accesses your contacts **only to allow you to share contacts with your
dumb phone and to display sender names instead of raw phone numbers**.

- Contact data is processed locally on your device.
- Contacts are **not uploaded to our servers**.
- Contacts are **not used for marketing, analytics, or advertising**.

### C. Phone Numbers

The App requires a smartphone number and a dumb phone number in order to enable text forwarding.

- These phone numbers are used **only to configure and enable text syncing**.
- We store:
  - The smartphone phone number
  - A flag indicating whether text syncing has been successfully set up
- We do **not** store message content or contact lists on our servers.

### D. Cached Group Chat Names

For the purpose of allowing users to mute group chats, the App may store **group chat names locally
on the device**.

- This data is cached on the device only.
- It is not uploaded or shared externally.
- It can be cleared by uninstalling the App or revoking permissions.

## 2. What We Do NOT Do

We do **not**:

- Sell personal data
- Share personal data with advertisers
- Use personal data for analytics or profiling
- Store SMS message content on our servers
- Access SMS or contacts without explicit user action

## 3. Permissions

The App requests the following permissions **only after explicit user action** and **only for core
functionality**:

- **SEND_SMS** – to forward messages to the dumb phone
- **READ_CONTACTS** – to access contacts for sharing and display
- **BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE** – to listen for message notifications when required by the device

You may revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings. Revoking permissions will
disable related features.

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do **not** share personal data with third parties.

- No SMS or contact data is sent to third-party services.
- We do not use analytics, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs.
- We do not transmit message content to any backend service.

## 5. Data Retention

- SMS and contact data is processed **transiently in memory** and not retained.
- Cached group chat names are stored locally until cleared or the App is uninstalled.
- Phone numbers stored for setup remain until the user disables text syncing or deletes the App.

## 6. User Control

You are always in control of your data:

- You choose whether to enable text syncing.
- You can revoke permissions at any time.
- You can stop all data access by disabling features or uninstalling the App.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is **not intended for children under the age of 13**, and we do not knowingly collect
personal information from children.
